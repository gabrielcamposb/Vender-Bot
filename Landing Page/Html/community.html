        <p><strong>@MidnightWanderer:</strong> Satoro Gojo Card</p>
        <p>
          Have any of you gotten the gojo card yet? I need it for my collection
          but i've never seen it on the server, is it really available?
        </p>

            @StarGazer92: I got it once but i traded it for another character,
            it's really very difficult to get this card. I think it's one of the
            rarest we have available

        <p><strong>@ElectricShoes:</strong> Guild System</p>
        <p>
          I was thinking that it would be a good idea to implement a guild
          system on the server using the Vender bot, what do you think?

            @EnigmaticEnigma: I think it would be a good idea, i had already
            thought about it before and mentioned it to some friends on the
            server. Maybe if more people support it they will start working on
            it.

            @CrimsonShadow: I read about it and saw that no special commands
            have been added yet, but believe they will be released soon
